CryptoCurrency,Update – Thank You All So Much!,"Hi everyone,  
I just wanted to come back here and give a proper update, especially after all the support and warnings I received.

I ended up telling my friend what was going on, and she was understandably very shocked. She really believed she was getting to know someone with genuine intentions, and to find out it was all a lie designed to scam her — it hit her hard. She’s upset, of course, but also incredibly thankful that she didn’t invest any money or go further. She kept saying she felt so lucky that we found out in time.

We confronted him and — surprise, surprise — he denied everything. By then, she was too hurt to keep talking, so I stepped in and told him straight: we know it’s a scam, we’ve reported both him and the site, and we’re done. (I might’ve said a little more than that… but you get the idea 😅)

But more than anything, I just wanted to say **thank you** — sincerely, deeply — to all of you who commented on my original post. Whether your replies were cautious, blunt, snarky, or kind — every single one helped open our eyes to the truth. And you helped protect someone from not just being scammed, but emotionally devastated.

I know it’s easy to scroll past things online, but you didn’t. You took the time to reply, to warn us, and to care. That means more than I can express. You may not realize it, but you truly made a difference in someone’s life.

Wishing every single one of you good vibes, smooth days, and lots of wins — in trading, in life, and everything in between. Hope the world treats you kindly. You’re all absolute legends, and I’m so grateful for this community.

Thank you. 💛",39

***Find the full blog post with all the tables and graphs*** [here](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-6)***.***

Welcome to your monthly no-shill data dump: Here's the fifth monthly report for the 2025 Top Ten Experiment featuring **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron,** and **AVAX.**

**SNAPSHOTS ALWAYS TAKEN ON FIRST OF THE MONTH (data below reflects 1 JULY Snapshot).**

**tl;dr**

* **What's this all about?** I purchased $100 of each of Top 10 Cryptos in Jan. 2018, haven't sold or traded, reporting monthly for 7.5 years for your reading pleasure. Did the same annually in 2019 - 2025. ***Learn more about the history and rules of the Experiments*** ***(including why in the world I would include stablecoins)*** ***on the blog.***
* **JUNE Highlights:** All flat or red, except **TRON.**  **BTC** in overall lead, **Tron** in second, **XRP** in third:  also the only three cryptos in the 2025 Experiment aren't underwater YTD. The Class of 2025 is now tied for the worst performing portfolio with the 2022 Top Ten.
* DCA'ing once a year into Top Ten Cryptos for the last 8 years has produced better returns than if you'd done the same with the S&P 500 over the same time period (+256% vs S&P500's +70% - see below for details).

# Month Six – Down -18%

https://preview.redd.it/jf3gp1jac1df1.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5d5bc6de106a986bf8a9dea335d5b4894e54ffa

The 2025 Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Portfolio is **BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, USDC, ADA, Tron, AVAX.**

June highlights for the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio:

* Flat or in the red 
* **Tron** outperforms the field in June
* Halfway through 2025, only three cryptos are in positive territory: **BTC, Tron,** and **XRP**  (just barely)

# June Ranking

Here’s a look at the movement in the ranks one month into the 2025 Top Ten Index Fund Experiment:

https://preview.redd.it/5rf4nvhbc1df1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc848d4c016db61171a8fcebf69cd91983093ee4

Six months into 2025, not much movement: only **AVAX** has dropped out of the Top Ten.  

# June Winners and Losers

***June Winners*** – **Tron** was the only crypto to finish in positive territory this month, up +3%.

***June Losers*** – **ADA** (-20%), **DOGE** (-17%), and **AVAX** (-17%) lost the most ground this month.

# Overall Update: BTC maintains slight lead over Tron, portfolio under water, AVAX and DOGE in last place

Year to date **BTC** (+13%) maintains a slight lead over second place **Tron** (+9%).  The rest are either flat or in the red with **AVAX** and **DOGE** taking up the rear at -52% and -50% respectively.

The initial $100 invested in first place **BTC** six months ago is worth $113 today.

YTD the 2025 Top Ten Portfolio is down -18%.  The last time the 2025 Top Ten portfolio was in positive territory was the end of [January](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2025-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-1)). 

# Overall return on $1,000 investment since January 1st, 2025:

https://preview.redd.it/nw0wskmcc1df1.png?width=253&format=png&auto=webp&s=49b066365f64cb5a03edc45e3cb65176967066ff

The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio shed $43 in June, about the same it gained in May.  The initial $1000 investment on New Year’s Day 2025 is now worth **$824**, roughly the same value as February and April.

Here’s a visual summary of year one of the 2025 Top Ten portfolio:

https://preview.redd.it/bz8xwchdc1df1.png?width=172&format=png&auto=webp&s=af0a814833a9a92f0c16192de0bbb71470b891ac

# 2025 Top Ten Portfolio vs. Coinbase’s COIN50

The first Top Ten Crypto Experiment was started on 1 January 2018 in an attempt to ***capture the gains of the entire market***. Much has changed over the last 7.5 years, including the introduction of index products designed to capture the entire crypto market (instead of manually buying coins and tokens [like I do for my Experiments](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/announcing-top-10-2025)).

This year’s friendly competition is between The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio and the Coinbase 50 Index **(COIN50)**.  **COIN50** tracks the performance of the 50 largest digital assets by market cap, rebalanced quarterly.

On 1 January 2025, **COIN50** was valued at $450.54.  Here’s the snapshot, six months later: 

https://preview.redd.it/f2qhbjpec1df1.png?width=203&format=png&auto=webp&s=a73ebc7e9437656cb2507ca1b76e692af33b469e

**June Performances:**

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -5% 
* **COIN50**: -3%

The June monthly victory goes to: **COIN50** (its third monthly victory in a row)

**Overall since January 1st, 2025:** 

* **The 2025 Top Ten Portfolio**: -18%
* **COIN50**: -14%

Overall lead:  **COIN50**

For the more visual, here’s the table I’ll be using to track the friendly Top Ten vs. **COIN50** competition this year:

https://preview.redd.it/30weblofc1df1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=18cb859bd4416132facdaf6f33e6d9b6cbb6e84a

# Combining the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Crypto Portfolios 

The 2025 Top Ten is one of eight concurrent experimental portfolios.  So, where do we stand if we combine eight years of the Top Ten Crypto Index Fund Experiments?

* 2018 Top Ten Experiment: up +46% (total value $1,457)
* 2019 Top Ten Experiment: up +668% (total value $7,683)
* 2020 Top Ten Experiment: up +867% (total value $9,674) (***best performing portfolio****)*
* 2021 Top Ten Experiment: up +301% (total value $4,015)
* 2022 Top Ten Experiment: down -18% (total value $824) (***tied for worst performing portfolio****)*
* 2023 Top Ten Experiment: up +153% (total value $2,533)
* 2024 Top Ten Experiment: up +44% (total value $1,444)
* 2025 Top Ten Experiment: down -18% (total value $824) (***tied for worst performing portfolio****)*

Taking the eight portfolios together:

**After a $8,000 total investment in the 2018 – 2025 Top Ten Cryptocurrencies,** the combined portfolios are worth **$28,453.**

https://preview.redd.it/3hokvf5hc1df1.png?width=501&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3e611002f9049635ea66fdfbe8a44428f0d946

**That’s up +256%** on the combined portfolio. The peak for the combined Top Ten Index Fund Experiment Portfolios was [**November 2021’s all time high**](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2021-top-10-cryptocurrencies-month-11/) of **+533%**.  

Here’s the combined monthly ROI since I started tracking the metric in January 2020:

https://preview.redd.it/wjpim6cic1df1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=d36aecfe9946dcb52f99c9a43cf8c3ca2066a2db

In summary: ***That’s a +256% gain by investing $1k on whichever cryptos happened to be in the Top Ten on January 1st (including stablecoins) for eight straight years***.

# Comparison to S&P 500

I’m also tracking the S&P 500 as part of my Experiment to have a comparison point to traditional markets.

https://preview.redd.it/fa00ytcjc1df1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6630f5b664991235098b32c20312517b6fc9804

The S&P 500 is up +5% so far in 2025, so the initial $1k investment into crypto on New Year’s Day would be worth $1,054 had it been redirected to the S&P.

Taking the same invest-$1,000-on-January-1st-of-each-year approach with the S&P 500 that I’ve been documenting through the Top Ten Crypto Experiments, the yields are the following:

* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2018 = $2,319 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2019 = $2,473 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2020 = $1,919 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2021 = $1,650 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2022 = $1,300 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2023 = $1,614 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2024 = $1,299 today
* $1000 investment in S&P 500 on January 1st, 2025 = $1,054 today

Taken together, the results for a similar approach with the S&P: 

**After eight $1,000 annual investments on January 1st into an S&P 500 index fund from 2018 to 2025 my portfolio would be worth $13,629.**

That is up **+70%** [since January 2018](https://toptencryptoindexfund.com/tracking-2018-top-ten-month-one/) compared to a **+256%** gain of the combined Top Ten Crypto Experiment Portfolios.  

The visual below shows a comparison on ROI between a Top Ten Crypto approach and the S&P as per the rules of the Top Ten Experiments:  

https://preview.redd.it/aypowpdkc1df1.png?width=1132&format=png&auto=webp&s=2079154c1cbb8f70a833dfc46e9141c2cd2f76cd

# Conclusion:

To the long time followers of the Top Ten Experiments, thank you for sticking around so long. For those just getting into crypto, I hope these reports will help prepare you for the highs and lows that await on your crypto adventures.  Buckle up, go with the flow, think long term, and truly don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.  Most importantly, take care of your family, yourselves, and try to enjoy the ride. 

A reporting note: I’ll focus on 2025 Top Ten Portfolio reports + one other portfolio on a rotating basis this year, so expect two reports per month.  June’s extended report is on the 2023 Top Ten Portfolio.  For more data, you can check out the latest 2018-2024 Top Ten reports as well.",60

CryptoCurrency,New to crypto: KuCoin vs JuCoin. Does platform size actually matter?,"Hey everyone, I'm pretty new to the crypto scene and currently looking into different exchanges to get started. Naturally, big names like KuCoin come up a lot, but I also stumbled upon JuCoin seems like a newer, smaller platform.

This got me thinking: does it actually make a difference if you go with a large, established exchange versus a smaller, newer one? Obviously, the bigger platforms have more coins and trading pairs, but sometimes newer platforms seem to offer perks like lower fees or more responsive support.

Curious to hear from folks who’ve tried both kinds of platforms what’s been your experience? Are there hidden trade-offs with going smaller? Or does the brand size not really matter if the features line up with what you need?

Not looking for shilling just genuine takes from actual users would be super helpful.

Thanks in advance!

CryptoCurrency,A dose of reality regarding this (read notes) “Altcoin season you all speak of.,"I come from the year 2021. The weather was fine, and the daily APY was thicc! the scams and rug pulls were there, but a lot more thought had gone into these projects. Ahhh OHM, TIME, STRONG.. take me back! Around 17,000 Alt coins existed back in those days (meaningful) with many of them dead. Liquidity was juicy after the COVID crash and the choice of alts to invest in MUCH smaller. Alts would pump 10x in a few hours. Launchpads were the real alpha and APY plays made you feel like you were really about to retire in a few weeks! Alas for many, it was simply moving liquidity to the early adopters.

Fast forward. It’s July 2025, we’ve had sunshine for a week in the UK and BTC.D is looking like it’s about to make moves. Many Altcoin moonbois from 2021 are now BTC maxis having joined the halls of BTC Valhalla with the once 2017 Altcoin moonbois! 
What’s left, a somewhat hopeful, slightly delusional and most certainly deep in the red group of crypto bros praying a 2025 AC Szn will set them free. 

At the end of 2021 around 400k tokens had been born, lived and died. By the end of 2025 it’s estimated there will have been nearly 100 million tokens created. As of today it’s believed there are hundreds of thousands of active / alive projects

Think about that number, think about how much liquidity is needed to nourish hundreds of thousands of projects this Altcoin season, draining liquidity - spread thin like butter. There simply isnt enough liquidity in the market to feed the hunger of all.

Sadly, MANY legitimate, great projects will see no more than maybe a 1-3x top 100s may see 50% to 1x.

This fabled Alt season will be like spreading butter over the world’s largest piece of toast.

I ofcourse hope you all get back to break even. And we will welcome you with open arms into becoming a BTC maxi when it’s all said and done :)",0

CryptoCurrency,Gated Communities Are Actually Great for Crypto—Marc Vanlerberghe,"For more than a decade, the crypto industry has championed decentralization, transparency, and self-sovereignty. These principles are noble—and in many ways, essential.

But, if we’re honest, they haven’t yet translated into broad, mainstream adoption. The dream of billions of people using blockchain every day is still largely that—a dream. To make it reality, we need to rethink how we build and deliver blockchain-powered experiences.

One of the biggest hurdles is usability. The current dominant interface to blockchain —non-custodial wallets—remains too complex for the average person. Managing private keys, writing down 24-word seed phrases, buying native tokens just to perform transactions, navigating multiple chains, bridging assets, KYC’ing repeatedly for each app, and figuring out how to convert crypto to fiat and back. This is not a user experience built for the mainstream....

CryptoCurrency,A shockingly clever new mini-advance-fee scam to steal crypto that doesn't even require interacting with the victim has appeared,"This is Atomic Shrimp's video talking about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TijuiMegg5o

I have seen a couple comments on YouTube that were attempting this scam, but especially knowing how greedy people are it really does seem like a good portion of crypto people would definitely fall for this because it preys on type of people who, if they saw a wallet stuffed with cash on the ground, would take all the money in it without a second thought.

In short, the scam is really quite clever and quite simple: the scammer loads a large amount of a valuable ERC-20 token (e.g. USDT or USDC) in some token onto a crypto wallet and then publicly shares the seed phrase in some naive-looking comment like this:

> Hey, I'm having trouble moving some of my crypto from my SafePal hardware wallet to Binance, can someone else help me? My seed phrase is [...]

An unscrupulous victim loads that seed phrase into their wallet and notices a large amount of some token, like 10,000 USDT in the wallet. However, the wallet is devoid of ETH/TRX/POLY/SOL/whatever other coin is needed to pay the network fee to withdraw the token. So the victim, intending to steal the tokens for themselves, send the required amount for the network fee into the wallet. However, to their dismay, the wallet is a 2-of-2 multisig and they can't actually send the tokens. The scammer, of course, controls both signers and uses this to withdraw the network fee that was sent by the victim.

While this scam could theoretically work on any network, Atomic Shrimp showed it happening on TRON, which actually makes the most sense when you think about it a bit more: on Polygon and Solana, the network fees are so low that the victims would only need to send a minimal amount to have enough to send the tokens away, so the scammers would only be able to steal some 0.01 POLY from each victim. On ETH, the opposite problem is presented: network fees are so *high* that stealing the victim's network fee payment would consume most of it in real network fees to transfer the booty out. But TRON's weird resource system makes it uniquely profitable.

For those unaware, TRON has two resources: energy and bandwidth. All transactions consume bandwidth and it is the physical transaction size in bytes. Each TRON address is allocated 600 units of bandwidth for free which regenerates over a 24-hour period. Energy, meanwhile, represents computational power which is consumed by smart contracts (equivalent concept to gas on ETH-like chains). Energy is not free and must be paid for by burning TRX or by staking it. Transferring TRX is not considered a smart contract call and thus it only requires bandwidth, which is free. Calling a smart contract (like the `transfer` function of a TRC-20 token) will consume bandwidth **and** energy, and it is quite expensive since TRON punishes frequently-used contracts by making their callers pay extra penalty energy units. At the time of writing, a transfer of USDT burns 13.5 TRX (at a cost of ~0.30 USD per TRX).

Thus, the victim would have to transfer in around 20 TRX with which to pay the energy cost to be safe, which is around 6 USD. This can then be yoinked by the scammers at no cost since transferring TRX costs only bandwidth which is free.",35

CryptoCurrency,CLARITY Act this week!,"Hey all, this is super important for everyone in crypto, not just ETH holders (but ETH ETF’s have a huge impact in terms of legal friction to finally supporting ETH ETF staking).

The CLARITY Act (H.R. 3633) is up right now, and it could seriously change the game for the entire space.

Why does this matter?

	•	Ends the constant “is it a security or a commodity?” fight.

	•	Defines truly decentralized and mature crypto projects as digital commodities, not securities.

	•	Protects staking, mining, validating — all core activities — so that whenever a crypto stakes it remains a digital commodity.

	•	Opens the door for more crypto ETFs, staking products, and DeFi innovation without SEC clampdowns.

Here’s an actual excerpt straight from the bill:

Including, as incentive-based rewards—
(i) to users of the digital commodity or any blockchain system to which the digital commodity relates;
(ii) for activities directly related to the operation of the blockchain system, such as mining, validating, staking, or other activity directly tied to the operation of the blockchain system; or
(iii) to the existing holders of another digital commodity, in proportion to the total units of such other digital commodity as are held by each person.
— CLARITY Act of 2025, H.R. 3633, Section defining “End User Distribution”

This is about more than just ETH — it’s about protecting the future of decentralized networks, DeFi, and anyone who actually wants to participate in securing or building the space.

If you care about crypto staying open and decentralized, call your rep. Even one call makes noise.

CryptoCurrency,How can I revive my coin?,"Curious if there's any hope or strategy to revive my coin.  It graduated to Raydium, had a market cap of over $300k and I locked up a lot of supply to be released to dog rescues.

The coin has good art, website, and even an AI bot in a dedicated chat space.  Some people have said to just launch a new coin, but that seems scammy to me.  I believe in this one and there are still some big wallet holders who believe in the narrative and I don't want to screw them over.

CryptoCurrency,"What to expect for Crypto Week July 14-18, 2025","The United States House of Representatives have OFFICIALLY set this week as “Crypto Week”. More specifically, Monday July 14 2025 – Friday July 18 2025. This is an epic historical moment for Cryptocurrency as a whole that may define and redefine regulatory changes, specifically for the United States. This could have global effects and implications as other nations may learn from this experience and decisions made this week. I wish they called it “Cryptocurrency Week” to make it more official instead of a shortened “Crypto Week” which makes it feel like it’s a fad or not as important in my opinion. Nonetheless, I don’t think any of us can complain that they are scheduling an ENTIRE week for cryptocurrency discussions, which is a historical moment for the United States cryptocurrency space.

# What is “Crypto Week”?

The United States House of Representatives has scheduled this week as “Crypto Week” to discuss and focus on all things cryptocurrency and related regulations and bills. They want to be the leaders for digital assets innovations and regulations while considering protection of the consumers and financial freedoms, or so they say. The week will include three major debates for “industry friendly” bills: Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, GENIUS Act, and CLARITY Act. We will get into more details on the Acts soon below. The hype and forecasted positive impact of Crypto Week in the cryptocurrency space has led a Bitcoin rally to new All Time Highs as well as a significant surge in cryptocurrency related stocks such as Coinbase, Micro Strategy, Block, Robinhood (unfortunately… I still have a long lasting bitter taste in my mouth anytime Robinhood is mentioned haha) and more.

Let us get into the nitty gritty of the major legislations that will be under debate this week:

# Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act)

·       H.R. 3633 - CLARITY Act

·       During last month, June 2025, the act passed the committees vote and is slated for a full House vote this week.

·       CLARITY Act hopes to define what a digital commodity is. Excludes stablecoins, derivatives, and securities!

·       Act will grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority of digital commodities while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will have authority over investment contracts and securities related to cryptocurrency.

·       Bill includes a mature blockchain exemption, which lets decentralized blockchains to raise capital (limited to a cap of 75 Million USD in a 12 month period) exclusive of Securities and Exchange Commission registration. This change allows for reduced burdens of fundraising for projects that are compliant.

·       Bill will require cryptocurrency dealers, brokers, and exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission while remaining compliant of their “strict” guidelines on transparency and protecting consumer assets.

·       Bill includes federal preemption for requiring KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) compliance as part of the already prevailing Bank Secrecy Act provisions. In short, this federal rule will supersede any State rules! I don’t agree with KYC… but we will have other non-KYC options hopefully!

# GENIUS Act

·       During last month, June 2025, the act was passed by the United States Senate.

·       GENIUS Act’s primary target is for stablecoins which are  cryptocurrencies that are designed to always have the same or consistent value… stable in a sense. They must be pegged to another asset, such as the United States dollar as an example.

·       Bill will require stablecoin creators/issuers have their assets backed by a reserve and to maintain the reserve requirement. This will protect consumers from liquidity failures… think Terra’s $LUNA fiasco… I hope this will ensure USDT and the rest of the stablecoins will need to PROVE their reserves!

·       If there is a bankruptcy for a stablecoin, the Bill will give repayment rights priority to coin holders first, which hopefully means retail consumers such as you and me (disregard if you are from an institution reading this HAHA)

·       Bill prohibits Congress and stablecoin senior execs from issuing stablecoins while they hold their public positions!

·       Bill enforces anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism sanctions on stablecoin issuers.

# Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21)

·       FIT21 passed the House vote way back in 2024 from BOTH major parties (Democrats and Republicans).

·       Bill is focused on bringing more clarity to regulations of digital assets which may include labeling tokens as commodities or securities (which I don’t agree with, cryptocurrency should be neither right?).

·       Bill will classify the digitalized assets coming from decentralized blockchains as a commodity under CFTC regulations while less decentralized digitalized assets will stay under SEC regulations (again, I don’t agree with this classification and I’m extremely curious what requirements they will decide on that determines a decentralized token versus a “less” decentralized token).

·       Bill will require decentralized blockchains to undergo a certification process.

·       Bill will require both the CFTC and the SEC to create more rules for anti-fraud in regards to cryptocurrency and digital assets specifically.

I am extremely excited that lawmakers and House leaders have designated an entire week for cryptocurrency discussions, promoting growth and innovation friendly agendas as a digital assets leader globally! This is a huge step forward towards mass adoptions of cryptocurrency and no nation can ignore cryptocurrencies any longer.

My hope is that these bills will offer clear, or at least clearer, legal certainty and promote innovations. As we see nations discussing stablecoins, we definitely need clearer rules for consumer confidence and to thwart future failures of current and new stablecoins. For example, I don’t know how Tether USDT has not proved that it’s backed by reserves (cash, equivalents, and Treasury Bills) and just hopes that we will take their “word” for it… Overall, I hope CBDCs are blocked for greater privacy for digital currencies.

What are your thoughts on Crypto Week and do you have any hopeful or expected impacts from the possible bills?",21

CryptoCurrency,Can Someone Explain to Me Why Anyone would Invest in Alt Coins?,"As the title says: can anyone explain to me why anyone would invest in alt coins?  I understand the argument for bitcoin appreciation - it's won the battle for digital store of value based on it's unique origin story, fixed supply and a culture that will always enforce that limit.  But store of value seems like pretty much a winner take all category.  Much like there was really only gold as the global store of value asset for 2000 years, it's reasonable to think that there might only be bitcoin far off into the future.



So, that's bitcoin, but what about the rest of it?   What is the expectation that any other token will appreciate over the long term?  Some of them might have interesting technology or perform some use case particularly well, but how does this utility lead to long term appreciation?  As the price goes up, it will just be undercut by new entrants offering the same service at a lesser price.  Utility tokens (for lack of a better word), just feel like commodities to me.  They may go up or down over the short term as they compete against each other, but in the long run they are all going to zero (or close to it).  The only argument I see for buying any of this stuff, is just to cynically get in, hoping to exploit the greater fools and get out in time.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

Bitcoin,The day will come when people will be amazed you could get in <$1m,"The ATH of 2017 was an astronomical $20,000USD, or thereabouts. Now, that seems absurdly cheap. The day will come when this too will apply to the current ATH. And the next. And maybe the next, too. 

We need to start thinking in intervals of 10, or even 100 million per coin.

The warchest I saved is being slowly sold off each month and I am so thankful to Bitcoin for giving me the opportunity of a lifetime to study in comfort for a couple years instead of the tough grind some students do - and really get the most out of this. And thankyou to all of you for gobbling up my precious sats and seeing this wild ride through for all these years.

Bitcoin,Did anyone notice $CANG’s move into Bitcoin mining? 50 EH/s now!,"
I came across some updates about Cango Inc. ($CANG) recently, and it’s pretty surprising how they’re expanding in Bitcoin mining.
	•	They’ve reached 50 EH/s, which is around 8% of Bitcoin’s total network hashrate
	•	Mined 450 BTC in June and currently hold 3,879 BTC
	•	They’ve now acquired an additional 18 EH/s, and their operations span across 4 continents (North/South America, the Middle East, and East Africa)

It’s interesting to see how fast Cango has pivoted from auto-finance to a major mining player. Do you think this shift will pay off, or is it just another trend? Curious to hear thoughts, especially on how they compare to others like $MARA or $RIOT.",2

Bitcoin,Why Is Bitcoin Pumping Without Retail Involvement 📈丨The Why Series,"Recently, Bitcoin's price has remained strong, but the real driving force isn't retail enthusiasm — it's institutional capital. ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT have attracted billions, pushing the market upward. Yet retail participation is still relatively weak, possibly due to lingering fear from past market crashes.

This divergence could mean institutions are accumulating quietly before the next wave of retail FOMO. Or, it might suggest that this rally lacks the organic momentum typically seen in full-blown bull markets.

There are clear upside signals — growing institutional adoption, clearer regulations, and limited new supply. But there are also risks: macro uncertainty, potential ETF outflows, regulatory pushback, or even a liquidity shock if sentiment shifts quickly.

This market may offer strong opportunities — but it’s not without risks. Rather than blindly chasing the trend or sitting out in fear, stay informed, manage your risk, and remember: even when the price moves up, the story behind the move matters just as much.

Here are a few things I'd love to hear about:

1. How often do you buy? Daily, weekly, monthly, or triggered by price drops?
2. Do you use any tools or indicators to time your buys? Are you purely automatic, or do you adjust based on market sentiment?
3. How do you budget for your DCA? Do you ever pause or increase contributions based on life events or market conditions?
4. Do you track your DCA performance? If so, what do you use? Spreadsheet, apps or a custom tool?
5. Are you DCA-ing only into Bitcoin, or do you include other assets?

Bitcoin,Could bitcoin miners subsidize a nuclear power plant?,"I was just thinking about this the other day. The price and overall market cap is up enough that it's not insignificant for large-scale miners to have massive amounts of both capital and Bitcoin at their disposal now. The miners are trying to get the most energy out of stranded energy connections so far. But what if Bitcoin miners could become part of the backbone of the energy infrastructure? They would be able to help startup projects that would need quite a bit of capital to get off the ground, like nuclear power plants and be able to provide demand for any energy provider which is willing to sell them energy at a low cost.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin ≠ Crypto: Why it Matters,"**Long read of the day -- and worth it if you want to know why BTC is not just another coin.**  
  
""Most normal people do not understand the distinction between bitcoin and other digital assets, and how and why they are very different things... Bitcoin isn’t just a technological breakthrough or a monetary experiment. Bitcoin is a moral proposition built on the history of technology, philosophy, and mathematics. It says that everyone, everywhere, deserves access to a fair and open financial system. It offers a form of money that resists censorship, operates beyond borders, and aligns incentives without relying on trust in fallible institutions.

This is not a small distinction. It’s the line between a world where financial power is centralized, opaque, and weaponized and a world where rules are enforced by code, not by decree.

Bitcoin,Best practise for storing a passphrase?,"So I know it should be kept separate to the seedphrase… Let’s say you don’t have a 3rd location to physically store a passphrase, is it bad practise to store it in an online password manager, or commit it to memory? 

Obviously the seed will never be stored in a password manager. 

Or how about this set up….

1. Seedphrase stored securely offline. 

2. A 6 word passphrase with the first 5 words stored in online password manager. 

3. The last word of the passphrase commited to memory.

Bitcoin,BTCDollar Experiment,"So with prior failures in yield generation, it’s a surprise to me that people still believe Bitcoin can earn yield outside of being traded on top of or locked up as collateral - all carry liquidation risk.

Flipping the script to recognize BTC itself as the yield got me thinking - kind of like how Shakepay pays interest on dollar deposits in BTC now, what if you had a USD Stablecoin with a 6% peg to BTC instead. That way, it doesn’t have to sit in the account and earn when idle, it can earn when being used in any account.

BTC gives it overall appreciation against USD - while staying within normal currency fluctuations in terms of volatility. Some of the USD could be parked in treasuries but why limit its liquidity right? Would it actually gain use before the world fully transitions to Bitcoin? Curious for thoughts.",5

CryptoMarkets,"BTC holding at $118, ETH ETF inflows again, Thiel's buying ETH. Retail still hesitant?","There's a steady shift happening, but a lot of people still don't seem to see it...

BTC is holding above $118K. ETH pushed past $3.1K. And ETH spot ETFs in the US have now recorded eight straight days of inflows - $192M on Monday alone, with BlackRock taking in $171M.

Meanwhile, Peter Thiel just picked up a 9% stake in BitMine Immersion Technologies, a company building an ETH treasury that now holds over 160K ETH. SharpLink just added another 6K ETH this week, bringing their total to 312K. And the Moscow Exchange is set to launch a new ETH ETF fund next month tied to BlackRock's product.

That's capital flowing in from multiple fronts - US, Europe, even Russia. Big players are accumulating quietly, yet retail sentiment still feels muted. The same people who called ETH undervalued at $2K are now calling $3.1K overbought. It's the same pattern every cycle.

From here, we probably grind higher while capital rotates. Disbelief is fuel. As long as the inflows keep coming and retail stays on the sidelines, BTC and ETH likely keep moving - slowly, structurally, and underexposed.

My take on all of this - ETH keeps grinding up while everyone's keeps waiting for a magical dip that's probably not coming. At some point this thing's going to rip and when it does - most will have already missed a golden opportunity and just FOMO in. Look closely and you'll see It's already happening, just not loud yet...",18

CryptoMarkets,Why moving significant crypto holdings into a bank account is more complex than it seems,"Turning large amounts of crypto into fiat can be unexpectedly challenging, even for people with fully legitimate funds. This is especially true for early adopters who relied on numerous exchanges over the years, including some that have since shut down.

While some banks claim to be crypto-friendly, most remain highly cautious due to regulatory scrutiny and the historic association of digital assets with illicit activity. In practice, the real obstacle often isn’t converting coins to fiat it’s successfully depositing that fiat without having the account frozen or the transaction rejected outright.

Several steps are critical if you want to avoid issues:

Carefully documenting the complete history of your transactions and sources of funds, which can require records going back many years.

Preparing a thorough audit trail covering all wallets, exchanges, and counterparties involved.

Understanding that internal compliance reviews are often more demanding than clients expect, and sometimes even front-office staff don’t fully grasp the process.

Without proper groundwork, people frequently encounter prolonged delays, repeated document requests, or outright refusals from banks.

Another problem that catches many by surprise is that older wallets can be labeled as high risk simply because they were connected to platforms like Mt. Gox, BTC-e, or Cryptsy. Forensic analysis tools (like Scorechain) can assign elevated risk scores to this historical exposure, regardless of whether today’s funds are clean.

CryptoMarkets,The Case Against Alt Season: AI Killed the Hype,"Altcoins used to thrive on vague promises and speculative hype, whitepapers full of jargon, tokens for ecosystems that never materialized, and endless talk of “utility” no one actually used.

But AI changed the game.

People have now tasted real tech. tools that work from day one.
Compared to that, a metaverse coin with no users and a roadmap full of buzzwords feels like vapor.

The bar is higher now. The public expects function, not fiction. And until most alts can deliver actual, immediate utility, the idea of another alt season looks more like nostalgia than inevitability.",0
CryptoMarkets,Quantum Tech Is Coming for Crypto—And These People Know It,"Chase Ergen, the son of DISH Network founder Charlie Ergen is making waves in the crypto world by tackling one of its biggest future threats: quantum computing.

He’s leading the Quantum Stablecoin Settlement Network (QSSN) project, a bold effort to future-proof blockchain infrastructure against quantum decryption. With quantum computers inching closer to breaking current cryptographic standards, Ergen’s work could be a turning point for DeFi security.

As a board member of DeFi Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: DEFT), Ergen is strategically positioned to push QSSN forward. One of the key partners here is BTQ Technologies Corp. (OTC: BTQQF), a post-quantum cryptography company led by Olivier Roussy Newton (also a DeFi Tech co-founder). BTQ is providing the core encryption layer for the project.

This collaboration aims to create regulation-ready, quantum-secure infrastructure to protect stablecoins and tokenized assets. Their shared goal: a resilient financial future built on DeFi that’s immune to quantum risk.

But it’s not just about tech. Ergen’s vision includes economic inclusion, too. He’s involved with the Make America Wealthy Again Super PAC, promoting DeFi as a tool for broader wealth-building access.

DeFi Technologies recently reported Q1 2025 revenue of C$62.7 million, pointing to growing institutional confidence.

🔐 Why this matters: If quantum computing breaks current encryption (and it eventually will), most of today’s crypto systems could be rendered obsolete. Projects like QSSN may be our best shot at surviving the next wave of disruption.",2

CryptoMarkets,"Hit $1,100 at 16 years old with crypto — what should I do next?","Hey everyone,

I’m 16 years old and I’ve been learning and dabbling in crypto for the past several months. So far I’ve managed to grow my initial money and now I’ve got about $1,100 in total invested. I’m proud of getting to this point because it took discipline, researching projects, and avoiding some of the hype and scams I’ve seen online. But now I’m at a crossroads and could use some advice from people more experienced than me about what to do next and what to keep doing.

Here’s a little background:
I started with just a couple hundred dollars that I saved from small jobs and gifts. I split it between some Bitcoin, a little Ethereum, and a couple of altcoins I researched. I didn’t chase meme coins or pump-and-dumps, though I admit I did take a very small gamble on a random token once — lesson learned. I’ve been using Coinbase and I always keep my seed phrases offline. So far I’ve just been holding. I don’t trade much.",26

CryptoMarkets,Large orders in the markets and how to work with them,"**Today I would like to talk about such a concept in the markets as density.**

Densities are a large order or orders of one large player. This could be a whale, a market maker or other large market figures.

These can be both sell and buy orders.

If in spot trading it is clear that there is only buying and selling and these orders are at least for real money of people, then in futures the picture is completely different.

Let me take the current situation on the TON coin as an example.

Today on a large number (2.97) there was a large order on futures to buy for 700 thousand dollars! This can mean only a few things: a large player wants to enter a position or it is a market maker. Since the work of market makers is not always visible, most likely this is an order from one of the large whales, who is probably more busy than us

*From the realization of density on futures, the price reacted upwards by 0.55% of the movement! Considering that the coin is not very volatile, this is a good movement and I consider it a beginning.*

To find such density, you need to use special screeners, of which there are now many on the Internet.

CryptoMarkets,FUD - what is it with people?,"Hello dear CryptoMarkets community,

I recently had a conversation with a friend who has deep knowledge and understanding of finance.

When I talked to him about opportunities in the crypto market, he told me to stay away from it. I replied that he was instilling in me fear, uncertainty, and doubt, in short, “FUD.”

What is it with people like that? Are they afraid of the changes disrupting traditional financial landscapes and techniques? Are they simply uncomfortable with the unfamiliar? Or are they jealous of those who specialize in technologies they don’t understand?

I’d love to hear your insights and opinions based on your experiences.

CryptoMarkets,Found some nasty crypto malware targeting new builders - here's what I discovered,"Hey guys, wanted to share this wild story that happened to me recently. Spoiler alert: I almost got completely fucked over by some really clever scammers.

So I launched [https://burntrash.fun](https://burntrash.fun/) a few weeks ago - it's a free tool to clean dust tokens from your Solana wallet. Pretty niche but useful for the community. I've been talking to potential partners to grow the project, you know how it is when you're building something new.

Recently I joined a Twitter space hosted by some Solflare ambassadors. Good vibes, lots of builders, seemed like a legit networking opportunity.

After the space, I followed a few speakers who seemed cool. One of them was [u/DiamondMarkiii](https://www.reddit.com/user/DiamondMarkiii/) who was presented as official Solflare staff at the time. A few days later, he slides into my DMs:

""Hey, I'm with [u/solflare](https://www.reddit.com/user/solflare/). We support creators & projects on Solana. Let's talk.""

Honestly? Sounds legit. We're both building in the ecosystem, this is exactly the kind of partnership outreach you'd expect. So I replied.

He then adds me to a group chat with what he claimed was the ""Solflare CMO"" and other team members. The whole thing felt very official and professional.

We set up a meeting. They're telling me [burntrash.fun](http://burntrash.fun/) is ""a nice product"" and they want to introduce me to their CTO to explore a potential integration.

But here's the clever part - they say the CTO is Chinese and doesn't speak English well. ""We use [u/harmony\_meeting](https://www.reddit.com/user/harmony_meeting/),"" they tell me, ""it auto-translates in real time.""

I'm thinking, okay, that's actually pretty smart. Makes sense for a global team to have tools like this.

This ""Harmony Meeting"" app requires me to download a .dmg file (macOS installer). No web version available. Has to be installed locally.

When I run it, it asks me to paste a command into my terminal.

At this point I'm like... wtf? Why would a meeting app need terminal access?

Instead of just running it like they probably hoped, I decided to actually examine what this thing was doing. Set up a Windows VM and started poking around the code.

What I found was absolutely terrifying:

* They're mounting a volume that automatically runs a base64 encrypted shell command
* This bypasses macOS's security quarantine system - the thing that's supposed to protect you from malicious downloads
* Then it executes a binary file containing malware
* No UI. No prompts. Just runs silently in the background.

You would literally never know it happened. Could be a reverse shell giving them complete access to your machine, could be scraping your passwords, seed phrases, browser data, crypto wallets - whatever they want.

Solflare is NOT involved in this at all. These were complete impostors using fake profiles and really well-crafted personas. They specifically target new builders who are looking for partnerships or support - basically when you're most vulnerable and eager for opportunities.

The level of social engineering here is insane. They:

* Infiltrated legitimate crypto spaces
* Built believable personas with consistent branding
* Created a realistic business scenario (CTO who doesn't speak English)
* Had a plausible technical solution (translation app)
* Made it feel urgent and exclusive

This whole experience reminded me why I always test stuff in VMs first. If I had just run their ""meeting app"" on my main machine like they suggested, I'd probably be completely compromised right now and wouldn't even know it.

The crypto space really needs better security culture. These scammers are getting scary good at social engineering, and they're specifically targeting builders who are excited about growth opportunities.",3

CryptoMarkets,Think wallet to wallet transfers are taxable? You’re not alone but here’s the truth," I’ve seen this so many times  someone moves crypto from their MetaMask to their hardware wallet and panics thinking they just triggered a taxable event.

So let’s clear this up:
If you’re just moving tokens between your own wallets, it’s not taxable.
No gains, no reportable event. The IRS sees that like moving money from one of your bank accounts to another.

BUT… there are a few important things to know:
	•	Bridges can be a trap. If your transfer includes a swap, burn, or mint under the hood (which some bridges do), that can be taxable.
	•	You must keep the cost basis accurate. If your software doesn’t carry over your original purchase price during transfers, you might get hit with short-term gains later when you sell.
	•	Tag your transfers. Label it clearly as “Internal Transfer” in your tracker or tax tool. If not, it might be misclassified as a trade.

I prefer softwares that correctly auto labels internal transfers + preserves cost basis. But whatever tool you use, double check.

Red flag: If your dashboard shows “gain” on a simple wallet transfer… something’s off.

Bitcoin’s hitting new highs with strong buying volume but the 24-hour long and short data shows retail traders are mostly short while whales stay heavily long. Since retail is mostly short here my guess is we’re probably getting shafted as usual. If BTC holds support and funding rates turn favorable there could be a short squeeze that pushes prices higher but history tells me retail often gets caught on the wrong side.

Retail shorts get squeezed hard when prices move against them but retail longs can also get hit if whales start unloading or the market turns. Either way retail traders will most likely end up on the losing side because they don’t have the same information or patience as the big players.

It's now up past 82 and I'd be up 10%.  Coinbase hates when you make limit orders and even makes it harder to do and discouraged it because then they can't rip you off by 1-2% right away. Have you ever place a one time order on coinbase and noticed that you're immediately down 1%? And when you sell, notice that they're shaving another 1% from your order if it's not a limit sell order? Coinbase is the worst.

You can literally save $100s on buying and selling crypto up to $10,000 per month. This pays for itself instantly.

CryptoMarkets,Why altcoins underperform BTC: imagine permanent sell limit orders,"Let's do a thought experiment.

Currently Strategy holds \~3% of Bitcoin supply. Average purchase price is \~$70k. Michael Saylor says he plans to never sell bitcoin. Also, 95% of total bitcoin supply is in circulation now - only \~5% left to be mined.

What would happen if Saylor changes his mind and decides to start selling, say, up to 50% of his BTC holdings at exactly $120k price (as an example)? You can imagine this as a **permanent sell limit order** with the price of $120k and enormous volume (1.5% of supply). Of course, technically it doesn't look like that, but conceptually it's the same: every time the price goes to $120k, the big seller would arrive and drive it back down.  
**The price would likely not go past $120k for a while** \- because even when demand grows, MSTR will always be there to sell some more of their bag at $120k.

**And now imagine** if Strategy held not 3%, but 30% of Bitcoin supply. Average purchase price is not $70k, but $7k. And Saylor's goal is to make money in short/medium term, so he's ready to sell every time the price goes up. Heck, he could even sell when the price is stable or goes down - he would still make a lot of money on top of $7k cost basis. Just need to not sell a lot at once, because that would scare retail investors.

Could BTC ever keep going up under such conditions?

**This is what happens with most altcoins**. It has nothing to do with the tech itself. The tech can be awesome, but the token ownership incentivizes early investors to sell whenever the demand grows, limiting the price growth potential. And that will continue to happen until they sell their big bags, which can be 50% of total token supply, or even more.

**What about memecoins?** Don't they have a more fair token distribution? Not really. They still have founders and early adopters - lucky people who got 1%+ of supply each for minimal prices. When the price goes 10x-100x and the token enters, say, top 100 of CMC - they will start to sell, limiting the price growth.

How can we identify altcoins that can outperform BTC in the long run? There is no guarantee, but here are a few metrics that we can look at, and compare it with BTC.

**1. % of supply in circulation.** Every time a token unlock happens, early investors get the token for free -  so they will always be incentivized to sell, driving the price down. If the token has, say, <80% in circulation, we can't expect the price to outperform BTC just because of this reason. BTC has 95%.

**2. % of supply held by whales**. A whale in CMC terminology is a wallet that holds >1% of total token supply. So if this number is, say, higher than 10%, we can expect that whale to sell when demand grows, to make profit. For BTC only 1.25% of total supply is controlled by whales.

**3. Historical price action in BTC.** There were big waves of retail demand for altcoins in the past. We can look at price of the token in BTC, not USD. For most of altcoins, it has a clear pattern: there is a surge every few years, and then a slow drop. And the surges usually get lower, and drops get deeper. Unless the tech makes a groundbreaking advancement and adoption explodes, we can expect the pattern to continue. And just to be clear, the adoption has to be bigger than the adoption for BTC. Because the whales holding 1%+ of supply will keep selling, so the demand needs to smash past that. It's much harder for altcoins than for BTC just because there are typically much bigger whales in terms of % of supply held.

Here is the analysis of top 20 coins (CMC data):

|Rank|Token|% supply in circulation|% supply held by whales|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**1**|**BTC**|**95**|**1.25**|
|2|ETH|100|47|
|3|XRP|59|No data|

|19|SHIB|100|61|
|20|TON|48|68|

**So is there any reason to invest in altcoins at all?**

I think the tech has potential, but projects should be selected very carefully. I don't think it makes sense to invest in projects with <80% supply in circulation (unless you're a huge believer in the specific tech) or with >10% held by whales. However, there is one exception to the last point. It is possible that the project foundation controls the large portion of supply (e.g. ETH, TRX), but they can be trusted that they won't limit the price action by constantly selling. I think TRX is the best example of this. Justin Sun controls \~70% of token supply, however apparently he makes the TRX price action follow the BTC price, so the TRX graph in BTC is quite stable since \~2020.

So even though TRX does not outperform BTC, at least it follows it. It's a rare exception for projects with large % of token supply controlled by whales. I think it's not a coincidence that Sun was [giving advice](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2025/01/22/justin-sun-claims-he-can-take-ethereum-to-10000/) to ETH foundation on how to keep the price up.

CryptoMarkets,Bitcoin’s silent advocate: why industry veteran Jameson Lopp sees apathy as the greatest threat,"Original title said ""opponent"". I changed it.  He is a long time advocate, as the article makes clear.

The best advocates are willing to have the tough conversations. 

The risk to existing cryptography is a problem and he outlines why it is even more of a problem for bitcoin. 

 ""We’ll have to come to consensus on these half a dozen things simultaneously, which is pretty much unprecedented. Given the slowing and the increasing difficulty and consensus changes to the Bitcoin protocol, this is why I started talking about it a year ago.""

I had learned of this issue as a buyer of Qanplatform. I was interested in how blockchain could deliver business value. I don't see it as an ""alt"" to bitcoin.  I see it going after a very different market than btc. 

And hence I've raised many of Lopp's same points. 

It serves both btc and QANX to do so. Certainly it highlights QANX was correct to include quantum resistance on its vision for enterprise blockchain. 

But it's also important for several reasons that Bitcoin addresses this. Tackling the issue head on prevents panic and removes this from being a ""fud"" topic.  Keeping bitcoin strong helps the entire space.

 Quantum computing news will continue to make headlines as it is a worldwide race. Every approach is being developed, with multiple innovations

The conversation has shifted from ""if"", to ""how fast will it be here"". 

As Lopp mentions in the article, governments want to be upgraded in less than 5 years. ",14

**Results:** [https://imgur.com/a/ZBHMqcq](https://imgur.com/a/ZBHMqcq)

It appears that this very simple **Long-only** strategy has consistently beaten **Buy & Hold** over time, on a **Performance/Risk basis**.

**The rules I used :**  

* Buy when price is above the 50 SMA. 
* Sell when it is below the 50 SMA.
* Position size : 100% of current capital (started with $5000)

**Fees are included (0.10% per side).**

I tried a lot of different SMA values, are there are multiple clusters of values that beat B&H when just buying or selling depending on the position of price from the SMA.

We all welcome advancement but those days, I thought this space was a space built by people for people. Because we literally show up here, spend hours studying charts, taking risks, feeling the emotions, but now bots, cold lifeless bots, get treated almost the same way as us.   
  
It gets to me. Because I’ve been in this market long enough to know how real the grind is. With all the sleepless nights, waking up in panic over sudden dips, the rush when you catch a good entry before the crowd, and every other positive/negative feeling. That’s watching bots enjoy the same access, same liquidity, same airdrops, and even win leaderboard competitions? It lowkey messes with my head. It’s part of development though but seeing how they can win from events. i just saw this ongoing bitget kCGI giving bots an avenue and this actually gave me a little form of envy. Cuz these things don’t even have the feeling to celebrate the win. It’s just someone behind them sitting with zero stress and waiting for a win. Copy traders own seems understandable but bots. Mehnnn…. All codes?

CryptoMarkets,"Tesla could've made $17 billion by holding Bitcoin. Instead, they flinched.","If they had accepted just 2% of car sales in BTC since 2021 and held onto it, they'd now have around 160,000 BTC - worth over $17B today. That's not a random stat. That's nearly half of Tesla's total profit over the last 4 years.

But in May 2021, they stopped accepting Bitcoin. Claimed environmental concerns. BTC dropped \~40% in days, and just like that - Tesla was out.

It's easy to point fingers, but there's a bigger takeaway here:

Bitcoin rewards conviction. Not perfection. Not timing. Just conviction. If you treat BTC like a trade, you'll always get shaken out. If you treat it like an asset - something to hold, protect, and build around - it will change your life.

Look at how the wealthy treat real estate: Buy it. Hold it. Let it appreciate. Borrow against it. Never sell. You don't sell the house because the market cools off for a year. You wait - and it pays.

Bitcoin is no different. It's scarce, it's global, and over time, it's proven to outlast the noise. So yeah - Tesla missed out. But the lesson stands:

Don't fade on Bitcoin. Stack more. Treat it like wealth. Use it like the rich use their assets. And let time do the heavy lifting.",59

I’m trying to understand whether it’s realistic to obtain a peer-to-peer loan in BTC without collateral, and whether trust-based lending still exists in the Bitcoin space. I know how risky that can be, but I’m open to learning more about the safer, more structured ways people handle this.

I’m not asking for a loan here, just genuinely interested in how others in similar situations approach this kind of need.

CryptoMarkets,For those who [day-]trade alts: [how] do you use BTC chart?,"Since alts ""follow"" BTC... I always have BTC open alongside my other trades. But as the movement is almost simultaneous, I don't feel like there is any specific advantage of knowing what BTC is doing - except for liquidation points. 

But if the S&R for BTC are the important measures even for alts, then is there any point tracking indicators on the alts? It would seem not. But this isn't correct anyway, because sometimes the alts don't move in lock-step to BTC. 

In fact, if you map BTC onto, e.g. NVIDIA or Palantir, you will see that there is consistency and overlap there too. 
So then I have to wonder: *does* BTC actually ""lead"" altcoins? Or does something more fundamental (global liquidity?) lead all of them equally?

Today I was taking a foto of my analysis on traadingview for my journal (im a scalper on forex and indexes. Be confortable to ask me any questions on the technical analysis of BTC) and found a picture of an unknown wallet titled Mnemonic 1.HEIC  next to ""Billetera principal. json"" that I have 0 knowledge where it came from. I own a 2020 MacBook Air M1 that is relatively new. I bought it on June of this year and its meant only for trading and analysis. I also visit websites like lichess and articles of various types. But I downloaded OKX Wallet yesterday and added my wallet that I had on my iPhone. But today I found this picture with the seed phrase of a wallet (I know opening it could be dangerous) that I have 0 knowledge to where it came from, since im not downloading nothing but screenshots from tradingview and apps from the App Store like Spotify and Notion and I don't even know how to use airdrop. The image is dated for the 2024, so its imposible that is one for one of my wallets or that I got it from the internet because as far as I know if I do  
My main concern is that my MacBook is vulnerable already  since I never took this foto and it's impossible that I dowloaded it from the internet by mistake. I know every OS is susceptible to hacking... But why would they just put an image on my divice instead of stealing my passwords or getting access to my wallet directly from OKX since the app is on it since yesterday. Im not posting the picture because I know it could be dangerous.

CryptoMarkets,BTCUSD's Strong Wednesday Surge – My Take/Position,"Hey r/cryptomarkets,

Hope you're all having a solid trading day! Just wanted to share what I'm seeing with BTCUSD right now and get some of your seasoned takes.

Looking at my chart (It's a 15-minute timeframe for clear price action), Bitcoin had a bit of a reset overnight, testing what looks like a pretty robust support level around the 108,400 mark. From that point, the buyers stepped in aggressively.

We've seen a really strong push upwards, decisively breaking out of what was a prior consolidation range/resistance zone (roughly 108,700-108,800). The current momentum is undeniable, and the candle formations are looking pretty healthy for the bulls.

My bias here is bullish, given the clean break and follow-through. I entered a couple of long positions earlier today, one at 108,634.84 and another at 108,642.04. Both are sitting in decent profit right now, which is always nice! My eyes are set on a target around 110,478.61, riding this current upward wave.

What are your technical observations on this move? Are you seeing strong volume confirming the breakout? Any key resistance levels you're watching further up? Always great to hear diverse perspectives on the market structure.
